# E-Library
A web application that manages online library services.

This application was developed using PHP language, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for web design.

### Program processes:
- Account management
- E-book reservations
- E-book management
- Transaction history report

**_E-Library_** contains 154 E-books to choose from. 
It also offers user account creation that is needed in order to borrow an e-book. 
Non-user can access the web page but is limited to browsing and cannot borrow an e-book. 
The borrowing system is queue-based which means other user cannot borrow an already borrowed book. 
Users can also request for a book that is not available on the platform.

On the admin-side, books can be added based on the user requests. They can also delete or edit an e-book
information. This side also creates transaction history report of a user.

Note:

- Extract .zip files to the same directory.
- Since this was develop for our university course requirements, e-books in this website does not contain their corresponding content rather just a sample e-book pdf to avoid illegal distribution of published materials.
